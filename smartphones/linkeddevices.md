# Check Devices Linked to Chat Applications

Many chat applications allow to link another device to the account in order to read and send messages from a computer. It is possible to use that feature to illegitimately get access to the account and messages exchanged by the application, it is thus interesting to check that there is no unknown session or linked devices.

## Signal
